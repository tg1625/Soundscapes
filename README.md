# Eclipse Soundscapes

This project is a prototype of a potential website for [https://arisalab.org/](ARISA Lab's) Eclipse SoundScape program. This was a part of a group project brief for NYU's User Experience Design class. Through this project, my group went through the full UX design process:
1. Creating a research plan/problem statement
2. Performing user research
3. Creating wireframes
4. Conducting usability testing
5. Creating a prototype
6. Iterating the prototype based on additional usability testing

While originally built using Figma, we found it difficult to demonstrate the interactive components of the design. As such, I put together this prototype using React in 24 hours.

As this is a simple prototype, it does not connect to any external APIs or provide any real data. This site is mainly to show the expected functionality of this design if it were put in production.
